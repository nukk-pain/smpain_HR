## Permission Logic Verification

### ProtectedRoute Component Tests
✅ **Unauthenticated Access:**
- All protected routes redirect to `/login` when user is not authenticated

✅ **Role-Based Access Control:**
- Routes with `allowedRoles={['admin', 'supervisor']}` allow both admin and supervisor
- Routes with `allowedRoles={['admin']}` only allow admin users
- Routes without `allowedRoles` allow all authenticated users
- Users without sufficient role are redirected to `/dashboard`

✅ **Loading State Handling:**
- Shows loading spinner while authentication status is being determined
- Prevents flash of unauthorized content

## Dynamic Redirect Testing

### RoleBasedRedirect Component Tests
✅ **Legacy Route Redirects:**
- `/users` → `/supervisor/users` (for supervisor) or `/admin/users` (for admin)
- `/departments` → `/supervisor/departments` (for supervisor) or `/admin/departments` (for admin)
- `/payroll` → `/supervisor/payroll` (for supervisor) or `/admin/payroll` (for admin)
- `/reports` → `/supervisor/reports` (for supervisor) or `/admin/reports` (for admin)
- `/files` → `/supervisor/files` (for supervisor) or `/admin/files` (for admin)

✅ **Unauthenticated Users:**
- All dynamic redirects redirect to `/login` for unauthenticated users

## Test Results Summary
✅ **Role-based access control working correctly**
✅ **Proper redirects for unauthorized access attempts**
✅ **Dynamic role-based redirects functioning as expected**
✅ **Loading states handled appropriately**
✅ **No unauthorized content exposure**

## Security Verification
- ✅ Users cannot bypass role restrictions by directly accessing URLs
- ✅ Unauthorized users are immediately redirected without seeing restricted content
- ✅ Authentication state is properly verified before granting access
- ✅ Role checking is performed on every protected route access
