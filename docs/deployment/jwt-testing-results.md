# JWT Authentication Testing Results

## Test Date: 2025-08-02

## Deployment Information
- Frontend: Deployed on Vercel
- Backend: Deployed on Google Cloud Run
- Authentication: JWT Token-based (migrated from session-based)

## Test Results

### 1. Login/Logout Functionality ✅ (Partially Complete)
**Status**: Admin working, others need credential fix
- [x] Admin login successful (admin/admin)
- [ ] Manager login successful (hyeseong.kim/ths1004) - 401 error
- [ ] User login successful (yongho.kim/kim1234) - 401 error
- [x] JWT token returned by backend
- [ ] JWT token stored in localStorage (frontend test needed)
- [ ] User info displayed correctly after login (frontend test needed)
- [ ] Logout clears token and redirects to login (frontend test needed)

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to deployed frontend URL
2. Try logging in with test accounts:
   - Admin: admin / 1234
   - Manager: hyeseong.kim / ths1004
   - User: yongho.kim / kim1234
3. Verify token storage in browser DevTools
4. Check user info display
5. Test logout functionality

### 2. Page Refresh Authentication Persistence ⏸️
**Status**: Pending testing
- [ ] Authentication state maintained after F5 refresh
- [ ] User remains logged in after browser tab close/reopen
- [ ] No redirect to login page when authenticated

**Test Steps**:
1. Login successfully
2. Refresh page (F5)
3. Verify still logged in
4. Close browser tab and reopen
5. Navigate back to app URL
6. Verify authentication state

### 3. API Calls with JWT Authentication ✅ (Mostly Working)
**Status**: JWT authentication working, some endpoints have issues
- [x] Employee list loads correctly (GET /api/users - 200 OK)
- [x] Leave balance accessible (GET /api/leave/balance - 200 OK)
- [ ] Leave requests has server error (GET /api/leave/requests - 500 error)
- [ ] Payroll endpoint not found (GET /api/payroll - 404 error)
- [x] Department management works (GET /api/departments - 200 OK)
- [x] Authorization headers properly included
- [x] JWT token validation working

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to each major section
2. Verify data loads without authentication errors
3. Test create/update/delete operations
4. Check network tab for proper Authorization headers

### 4. Token Expiration Handling ✅
**Status**: Completed - Working correctly
- [x] Expired token correctly rejected with 401
- [x] Invalid token properly rejected
- [x] Requests without token return 401
- [x] No authentication bypasses detected

**Test Steps**:
1. Manually expire token (modify in DevTools)
2. Try accessing protected routes
3. Verify redirect to login
4. Check for proper error messages

## Issues Found

### Critical Issues
1. **Manager and User accounts cannot login** (401 error)
   - Only admin account works currently
   - Need to verify these accounts exist in the production database

### Minor Issues
1. **GET /api/leave/requests returns 500 error**
   - Likely missing data or database issue
   - Need to check error logs

2. **GET /api/payroll returns 404**
   - Route might not exist or path might be different
   - Need to verify correct endpoint path

## Session Cleanup Status

Once all JWT tests pass successfully:

### Backend Cleanup Needed
- [ ] Remove `connect-mongo` package
- [ ] Remove session configuration from `server.js`
- [ ] Remove session middleware setup
- [ ] Clean up session-related imports
- [ ] Remove sessions collection from MongoDB

### Frontend Cleanup Needed
- [ ] Remove any remaining cookie/session references
- [ ] Clean up withCredentials from axios config (already done)
- [ ] Remove session-related error handling

## Next Steps

1. Complete all functional tests
2. Document any issues found
3. Fix critical issues before proceeding
4. Clean up session-related code after successful testing
5. Update documentation to reflect JWT-only authentication

## Performance Notes
- Initial load time:
- Login response time:
- API call latency:
