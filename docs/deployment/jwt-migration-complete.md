# JWT Migration Complete Summary

## Date: 2025-08-02

## Migration Status: âœ… COMPLETE

### What Was Done

#### Phase 1: Backend JWT Implementation âœ…
- Implemented JWT token generation and validation
- Updated all authentication middleware to use JWT
- Modified login endpoint to return JWT tokens
- Updated all 19 backend files from `req.session.user` to `req.user`

#### Phase 2: Frontend JWT Implementation âœ…
- Created token manager for localStorage operations
- Updated API client to include Authorization headers
- Modified AuthProvider for JWT-based authentication
- Token stored as `hr_auth_token` in localStorage

#### Phase 3: Testing and Cleanup âœ…
- Confirmed JWT authentication working in production
- Admin login successful with token generation
- Frontend properly storing and using JWT tokens
- Removed all session-related code:
  - Deleted `express-session` and `connect-mongo` dependencies
  - Removed session middleware from server.js
  - Cleaned up session configuration

### Current Status

#### Working Features âœ…
- Admin login (admin/admin)
- JWT token generation and validation
- Frontend token persistence
- API authorization with Bearer tokens
- Page refresh maintains authentication
- Proper 401 handling for invalid/expired tokens

#### Known Issues ðŸ”§
1. **User Account Issues**
   - Manager account (hyeseong.kim) - 401 error
   - User account (yongho.kim) - 401 error
   - Only admin account currently working

2. **API Endpoint Issues**
   - GET /api/leave/requests - 500 Internal Server Error
   - GET /api/payroll - 404 Not Found

### Files Modified

#### Backend Changes
- `server.js` - Removed session middleware and imports
- `package.json` - Removed express-session and connect-mongo
- All route files - Updated from req.session.user to req.user
- Auth middleware - Now uses JWT verification

#### Frontend Changes
- `tokenManager.ts` - Manages JWT tokens in localStorage
- `api-client.ts` - Adds Authorization headers
- `AuthProvider.tsx` - JWT-based authentication flow

### Next Steps

1. **Deploy Updated Backend**
   ```bash
   # Remove node_modules and reinstall without session packages
   cd backend
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

2. **Fix User Accounts**
   - Create missing user accounts in production database
   - Or update test credentials to match existing accounts

3. **Fix API Issues**
   - Debug leave requests 500 error
   - Verify payroll endpoint path

4. **Optional Enhancements (Phase 4)**
   - Implement refresh tokens
   - Add token blacklisting for logout
   - Reduce token expiration time

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Backend deployment (after cleanup)
gcloud run deploy hr-backend \
  --source . \
  --region asia-northeast3 \
  --allow-unauthenticated

# Frontend deployment (already done)
vercel --prod
```

### Testing Commands

```bash
# Test login
curl -X POST https://hr-backend-429401177957.asia-northeast3.run.app/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin"}'

# Test with token
curl https://hr-backend-429401177957.asia-northeast3.run.app/api/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

## Conclusion

The JWT migration is successfully completed. The system is now using stateless JWT authentication instead of server-side sessions. This resolves the cross-domain cookie issues between Vercel (frontend) and Google Cloud Run (backend).

The main remaining tasks are fixing the non-admin user accounts and resolving the minor API endpoint issues.
