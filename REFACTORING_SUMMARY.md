res.json({ success: true, data: users });
res.status(200).json({ users: users, message: 'Success' });
res.send({ result: users, status: 'ok' });
```

```javascript
// Single consistent pattern
successResponse(res, users, 'Users retrieved successfully');
errorResponse(res, 400, 'Validation failed', errors);
```
