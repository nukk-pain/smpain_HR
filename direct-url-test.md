### Authentication Flow
✅ **Unauthenticated Direct Access:**

- After login, user can access appropriate pages based on role
- No unauthorized content exposure

✅ **Session Persistence:**
- Direct URL access works with existing sessions
- JWT tokens properly validated
- Page loads correctly with user context

## Technical Implementation Verification

### React Router Configuration
✅ **Route Matching:**
- Nested routes (e.g., `/admin/leave/overview`) match correctly
- Exact path matching prevents conflicts
- Wildcard route handles unknown paths

✅ **Server-Side Rendering Compatibility:**
- All routes work with client-side navigation
- Deep links resolve correctly on page refresh
- No hydration mismatches

### URL Structure Validation
✅ **Consistent Patterns:**
- Role-based prefixes (`/supervisor/`, `/admin/`) work correctly
- Nested paths (`/admin/leave/overview`) resolve properly
- Public routes (no prefix) accessible as expected

✅ **Browser Compatibility:**
- URLs work across different browsers
- Special characters handled properly
- Path resolution consistent
