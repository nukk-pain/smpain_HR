# Production Test Execution Plan (TDD Approach)

## Overview
This plan follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology to verify production deployment functionality. Each test will be written first, then executed to verify the actual system behavior.

## üîÑ **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW (Updated 2025-08-06)**

### **Phase A: Local Development & Testing**
1. Write failing test that describes expected behavior
2. Implement feature locally to make test pass
3. Run local tests to verify functionality
4. Continue with next test locally
5. **Batch all changes for single deployment**

### **Phase B: Production Deployment & Verification** 
1. Deploy all accumulated changes to production
2. Run complete test suite against production environment  
3. Mark tests with production status:
   - üß™ **LOCAL READY**: Implemented and tested locally
   - ‚úÖ **PROD VERIFIED**: Confirmed working in production
   - ‚ùå **PROD FAILED**: Issues found in production
4. Fix any production-specific issues

## Test Execution Instructions
1. Write a failing test that describes expected behavior
2. Implement locally first, then batch deploy
3. Verify in production environment after deployment  
4. If test fails in production, document the issue
5. If test passes in production, mark with ‚úÖ and move to next test
6. Follow the Red ‚Üí Green ‚Üí Refactor cycle

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **If all tests pass**: System is ready for production use
2. **If critical issues found**: Fix immediately before release
3. **If minor issues found**: Document and plan fixes
4. **Performance issues**: Optimize before heavy usage
5. **Security issues**: Patch immediately

Remember: Follow TDD principles - write the test first, see it fail against production, then verify it passes.
