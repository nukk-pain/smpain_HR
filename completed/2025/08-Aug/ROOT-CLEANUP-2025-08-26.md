## Cleanup Actions Completed

### 1. Created Organization Structure

│   └── completed/      # Completed plans
├── documentation/
│   ├── testing/        # Testing guides and plans
│   └── guides/         # User and development guides
└── completed/          # All completed work
```

### 2. Files Moved

#### To `plans/completed/`:
- REFACTOR-08-error-logging-service-plan.md
- REFACTOR-09-unified-leave-overview-plan.md

### 3. Files Remaining in Root (Essential Only)

Only 4 critical files remain in the root directory:

1. **README.md** - Project overview and setup instructions
2. **INDEX-PLAN.md** - Main development tracking document
3. **CLAUDE.md** - Claude Code instructions (checked into repo)
4. **CLAUDE.local.md** - Local Claude Code instructions (not checked in)

Plus standard project directories:
- backend/
- frontend/
- docs/
- scripts/
- completed/
- plans/
- documentation/
- (other project directories)

### 4. Cleanup Statistics

- **Before**: 30+ markdown files in root
- **After**: 4 essential files only
- **Files organized**: 26+ documents
- **Organization improvement**: 87% reduction in root clutter

### 5. Benefits Achieved

✅ **Clear root directory** - Only essential files visible
✅ **Logical organization** - Plans separated by status
✅ **Easy navigation** - Related files grouped together
✅ **Better tracking** - Active vs completed work clearly separated
✅ **Maintained history** - All files preserved in appropriate locations

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Regular maintenance**: Move completed plans to `plans/completed/` weekly
2. **Archive old completed work**: Consider yearly archiving of `completed/` folder
3. **Documentation updates**: Keep README.md and INDEX-PLAN.md current
4. **Git cleanup**: Add large completed folders to .gitignore if needed
