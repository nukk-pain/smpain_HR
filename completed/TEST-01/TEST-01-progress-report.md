# Integration Test Suite - Progress Report

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Test Environment Setup

1. **Jest and Supertest Configuration**
   - âœ… Jest already installed with v29.5.0
   - âœ… Supertest already installed with v6.3.3
   - âœ… Created comprehensive test configuration in package.json

2. **Test Database Setup**
   - âœ… Created global setup/teardown scripts
   - âœ… Configured test database (hr_test) separate from production
   - âœ… Created test data seeders with proper bcrypt hashing
   - âœ… Environment configuration (.env.test) for test-specific settings

3. **Test Helpers and Utilities**
   - âœ… Created setupTests.js with JWT token generation helpers
   - âœ… Created test database connection utilities
   - âœ… Added test data insertion/cleanup helpers

4. **Authentication Tests Written**
   - âœ… Created comprehensive auth.test.js with 17 test cases
   - âœ… Tests cover login, logout, auth check, and password verification
   - âœ… Added /api/auth/check endpoint implementation (was missing)

## ðŸš§ Current Issues

### Server Initialization Problem
The main blocker is that the server.js file is hanging during test execution:
- Server tries to connect to MongoDB and perform extensive initialization
- Multiple services are initialized (monitoring, error logging, etc.)
- The connection process doesn't complete in test environment
- Tests timeout after 30+ seconds

### Root Causes Identified
1. **Complex Server Initialization**: server.js performs too many operations unsuitable for testing
2. **Database Connection**: Server connects to wrong database (SM_nomu instead of hr_test)
3. **Service Dependencies**: Multiple monitoring services start that aren't needed for tests
4. **Async Operations**: Unclosed connections and intervals prevent Jest from exiting

## ðŸ“‹ Recommendations for Next Steps

### Option 1: Refactor server.js (Recommended)
Create a separate app.js that exports the Express app without starting the server:
```javascript
// app.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
// ... configure routes and middleware
module.exports = app;

// server.js
const app = require('./app');
app.listen(PORT, () => {...});
```

### Option 2: Mock Server Dependencies
- Mock monitoring services
- Mock complex initializations
- Use test-specific configuration

### Option 3: Use Test-Specific Server
- Create a minimal test server configuration
- Skip unnecessary services for tests
- Direct database connection without complex setup

## ðŸ“Š Test Coverage Status

| Category | Tests Written | Tests Passing | Coverage |
|----------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| Authentication | 17 | 11 | 65% |
| Users | 0 | 0 | 0% |
| Leave | 0 | 0 | 0% |
| Payroll | 0 | 0 | 0% |
| Departments | 0 | 0 | 0% |
| Documents | 0 | 0 | 0% |
| Reports | 0 | 0 | 0% |

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Action Items

1. **Fix Server Initialization**
   - Separate app configuration from server startup
   - Make database connection configurable
   - Allow disabling of monitoring services in test mode

2. **Complete Auth Tests**
   - Fix remaining 6 failing tests
   - Ensure all auth endpoints work correctly

3. **Continue with Phase 2**
   - Implement remaining API endpoint tests
   - Follow TDD principles for each endpoint

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons Learned

1. **Server Architecture**: The current monolithic server.js makes testing difficult
2. **Database Separation**: Test database must be completely isolated
3. **Service Dependencies**: Optional services should be configurable
4. **TDD Application**: Tests revealed missing endpoints (e.g., /api/auth/check)

## ðŸ”„ Next Session Focus

1. Refactor server.js to separate app configuration
2. Fix remaining authentication test failures
3. Begin user management API tests
4. Document test execution commands
